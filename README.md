# Poker-Game

The goal of this assignment was to create the functionality to run a poker game where two players would be distrubuted a hand each. 
The hand would then be evaluated (pair, triple, flush, straight) and the two hands compared to establish a winner.
I designed the initial part of this project around 5 classes: Card, Deck, PokerHand, PokerGame, ExerciseTwo (driver class).
I expanded on the assignment to include additional possible hands such as royal flush, two pair, and straight flush.
I also set it up to work with any number of players from 2 to 8. 
The hands are all dealt from the same deck, evaluated, and a winners list is created based on the highest hand value.
The program then prints the list of winner to the screen. 

Areas for development:
1) Each player has the choice of returning up to three cards in order to try for a better hand value.
2) Player can interact with the game rather than simply running the program.
3) Introduce a bet system for each player.
4) Create computer controlled players who bet on good hands and have a chance to bet on bad hands (i.e. bluff).
5) Create AI for the computer controlled players to learn how to play good hands and when to bluff.
